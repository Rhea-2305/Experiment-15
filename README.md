# Experiment-15
## Program 1
## Aim
Find the factorial of a number using recursion

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to tackle smaller instances of the same problem. For example, to compute the factorial of a number \( n \) (denoted as \( n! \)), the function repeatedly calls itself with \( n-1 \) until it reaches the base case.

The factorial is defined as \( n! = n \times (n-1)! \), and the base case is \( 0! \) or \( 1! \), both equal to 1. Recursion stops when the base case is reached, and results are combined as the function returns from each call.

## Conclusion
We found the factorial of a number using recursion in C++.

## Program 2
## Aim
Find the Fibonacci number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

## Conclusion
We found the fibonacci series for n number using recursion in C++.

## Program 3
## Aim
Find sum of n natural numbers using recursion, n is the value entered by user.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
To find the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers using recursion, you break it down into smaller parts. The formula is: \( \text{Sum}(n) = n + \text{Sum}(n-1) \). The base case is when \( n \) is 1, since the sum of the first natural number is 1. The function adds the current number \( n \) to the sum of the previous numbers until it reaches the base case, then returns the total.

## Conclusion
We learned how to add n numbers using recursion in C++.
